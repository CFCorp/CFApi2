# Other stuff

### Coming soon

- More endpoints
- Improved randomness
- Better response times

#### FAQ
 Why do I get an error?
 - the most likely issue is that you are using the default user-agent

 Can i help?
- Yes of course just make a PR.

 Will it work on my PC?
- I don't recommend using my stuff but only for testing purposes (maybe).

What is the difference between version 1 and version 2?
- The backend of both of the versions are completely different and optimized for different types of workload due to this [v1](https://github.com/CFCorp/CFsAPI) will be depreciated and not accessible anymore in the future when [v2](https://github.com/CFCorp/CFApi2) is fully released.

What are you using redis for?
- it is just a simple caching step between the API requests and the images it just makes loading the images a bit more optimzed and faster due to this if you decide to run it on your own machine Redis is highly recommended to be used.

Why are you rebuilding your API
1.  PHP is slow and I want better speed
2. PHP setup is a pain in the ass
3. I want to learn some new stuff

# So what will change?

- Backend in Rust
- Frontend in Python With C
- Database will be switched to MongoDB
- Dashboards
- Login Page
- Authentication Methods
- User Tokens and UUIDs
- a lot of minor stuff

# Is there a chance that the code will be public
- ~~Yes it will be in the future fully open source~~ It now is

# Roadmap / TODO

- [ ] Make the whole backend
- [ ] Make the frontend
- [ ] remake the login page
- [ ] remake the dashboard
- [ ] remake the loggers
- [ ] add tagging
- [ ] 2FA
- [ ] Better Uploaders
- [ ] Redis Caching


# Requirements:
- Rust
- Python 3
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Web Server

### How to setup for dummy's
#### Recommended is Linux/Unix
Download & install Python and Rust for this project then run these 2 commands
`cd FrontEnd && Python3 index.py`.
`cd BackEnd/neat-api && cargo run`

Change stuff in the `.env` to make it be able to connect to the database and set the right logging level

##### Setup database
Change the correct variables in your own `.env` file then run `cargo run` it will auto populate the database

# How to do oauth tokens
### Endpoints
- Will explain this at a later point, will also add some stuff to the dashboard to simplfy the process
