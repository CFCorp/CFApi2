# Other stuff

### Coming soon

- More endpoints
- Improved randomness
- Better response times

#### FAQ
 Why do I get an error?
 - the most likely issue is that you are using the default user-agent

 Can i help?
- Yes of course just make a PR.

 Will it work on my PC?
- I don't recommend using my stuff but only for testing purposes (maybe).

What is the difference between version 1 and version 2?
- The backend of both of the versions are completely different and optimized for different types of workload due to this [v1](https://github.com/CFCorp/CFsAPI) will be depreciated and not accessable anymore in the future when [v2](https://github.com/CFCorp/CFApi2) is fully released.

What are you using redis for?
- it is just a simple caching step between the API requests and the images it just makes loading the images a bit more optimzed and faster due to this if you decide to run it on your own machine Redis is highly recommended to be used.


# Requirements:
- Web server (Apache/Nginx, PHP, PostgreSQL)
- Redis

### How to setup for dummy's
#### Recommended is Linux
Download & install composer and after that run this in the project directory
`composer install --optimize-autoloader`.

Change stuff in the `.env` to make it be able to connect to the database and set the right logging level

##### Setup database
Change the correct variables in your own `.env` file and then run the migration command with `php` that is built-in to this `php artisan migrate:fresh`

# Roadmap / todo list:
- Create a dashboard with all of the statistics and a token generator
- Caching with Redis
- Simple file uploader
- 2FA for login
- Remove registration page that is used for debugging
